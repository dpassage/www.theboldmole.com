I've had Swift on the brain for much of the second half of the year. While
there are still rough edges, I've really enjoyed how it encourages the
adoption of value types, functional paradigms, and other modern things.

And now that all changes. I've accepted a full-time job as a software engineer
for a startup. It's been fun poking at code over the last couple of years, but
now I'll really need to be focused and productive full-time.

My first task looks like it will be to build a web e-commerce site. So I'll be
reaching back into my toolbox for Ruby on Rails, Postgres, and the like, and
probably digging into some JavaScript front-end frameworks.

Strong typing goes away; duck typing comes back. FRP with ReactiveCocoa goes
away; web transactions come back, possibly with some ReactJS polish later on.
All the smarts on my web server; only as much as I don't have to fully trust
on the client. And authentication, security...

I'm looking forward to the challenge and getting back to the web, but the
transition is big. Time to cull out my iOS/Swift blogs and get Rails spun
up...
