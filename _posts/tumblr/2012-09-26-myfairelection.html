<p>Since we last spoke, my good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/smoodle">Karen Suhaka</a> convinced me to come on a bit of a mad dash with her&#8230;</p>

<p>The idea is called MyFairElection, and the &#8220;X for Y&#8221; version of the description is &#8220;Yelp for polling places&#8221;.</p>

<p>So to be successful - we need to build a site that&#8217;s usable and robust, than can deal with a number of weird corner cases in how states and jurisdictions deal with voting, and that can scale up to thousands of polling places and potentially millions of users.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s just a little bit audacious, and has a hard deadline fixed by law.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re in the initial building stages now. The decision we need to make in the next 2 weeks will be whether we think we can make it; if not, the backoff is to have it ready for a smaller election sometime in 2013, with the aim of building the brand for the big national elections in 2014 and 2016.</p>

<p>In terms of technology - starting with Rails and MySQL, with hosting provided by Rackspace. Trying to be uber-BDD - but then I just threw Devise into the thing without writing a single test. The adventure will continue&#8230;</p>
