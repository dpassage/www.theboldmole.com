<p>I&#8217;ve changed direction from Rails into iOS programming now&#8230; And ran into a big frustration point.</p>

<p>The app I&#8217;m working on needs to record and play back audio. So into AVFoundation I go!</p>

<p>The API annoys me. There are a few methods on <code>AVAudioPlayer</code> which can return false in case of error - but there&#8217;s no way to tell what the error is. So you have to jerk around experimenting for a while until you figure it out.</p>

<p>Gee. Thanks, Apple.</p>

<p>In my particular case, the <code>play</code> method was returning false; this seems to be because I had not set the audio session category correctly. I&#8217;ve yet to find somewhere in the Apple API documentation where it talks about the consequences of having your <code>AVAudioSession</code> set up incorrectly.</p>
