<p>If you are running:</p>

<ul><li>Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4</li>
<li>Xcode 4.3.3 installed via the App Store</li>
<li>ruby 1.9.3</li>
</ul><p>&#8230;and you&#8217;ve removed previous versions of the Xcode environment, when you build gems with native extensions, you may see this:</p>

<pre><code>/Users/dpassage/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p125/bin/ruby extconf.rb
creating Makefile

make
compiling autolink.c
make: /usr/bin/gcc-4.2: No such file or directory
make: *** [autolink.o] Error 1
</code></pre>

<p>This means you need to upgade your ruby!  ruby 1.9.3-p125 contains a patch which hardcodes the gcc version used on OS X as gcc-4.2.  The newer version fixes this, and just uses /usr/bin/gcc.  As it should.</p>
